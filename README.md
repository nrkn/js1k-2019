## Minification Strategy

- pack sprites into strings using a hand-written tool
- keep code as simple and samey as possible to ensure good packing
- add one feature at a time and only golf down when we go above 1024 bytes
- iterate, iterate, iterate! At every iteration:
  - use [uglify](https://skalman.github.io/UglifyJS-online/) for minification
    - examine the minified code to find things that didn't minify as well as they
      could have
  - use [regpack](http://siorki.github.io/regPack.html) for packing
    - look at what tokens nearly had a compression gain and try to reuse them
      elsewhere
- use GitHub, check in often
- use [TypeScript](http://typescriptlang.org/) to help catch typos and errors in ugly, complicated code

### Tricky/weird stuff to save bytes:

- Bit level packing and unpacking sprites to and from strings, using a size
  that ensures each sprite row fits into the printable ASCII range 32-127
  so that 1 row never exceeds 1 byte
- Adding properties to arrays so that they can be both iterated over and also
  directly queried for data
- Inlining to a ludicrous degree at the expense of readability

## Sprite Encoder Tool

Takes a sprite sheet saved as PNG, and spits out a packed string

If you're interested in the code, let me know and I'll tidy it up and release
it on GitHub

## A Visual Development History

NB, this only shows some interesting milestones, there are a lot more
[commits](https://github.com/nrkn/js1k-2019/commits/master) involving all kinds
of golfing, experimenting, abandoned features, bug fixes etc.

### [47c5903123f6a9207bfab96ab21c4a62ab7ca7e9](https://github.com/nrkn/js1k-2019/tree/47c5903123f6a9207bfab96ab21c4a62ab7ca7e9)

This was my first proper commit. It was just to test that I could draw the
sprites - the colours were picked pretty much at random, which is why it looks
so weird. The map just picks a sprite at random for each tile.

At this stage I was planning to make a 1k version of my JS13k game,
[Ranger Down](https://js13kgames.com/entries/ranger-down), so the sprites were
adapted from those.

### [b8c0284f6a8e91c3b82c8453e08fdb05d6a80b31](https://github.com/nrkn/js1k-2019/tree/b8c0284f6a8e91c3b82c8453e08fdb05d6a80b31)

OK - after crunching some numbers I realised that Ranger Down was too ambitious
- there was no way I was going to get something even resembling it done in 1k.
I decided to fall back to a Roguelike, I've done plenty of those before. I
generated some rectangular rooms and used a graph to connect them together with
corridors:

![dungeon](public/b8c0284f6a8e91c3b82c8453e08fdb05d6a80b31.png)

Here's a dungeon generated by the graph-based algorithm - not bad!

![graph-dungeon](public/graph-dungeon.png)

### [dd846797e6a0fdb52d0a9729556499e840983ec8](https://github.com/nrkn/js1k-2019/tree/dd846797e6a0fdb52d0a9729556499e840983ec8)

Then I added some monsters - a ghost seemed like a good monster to use, it's
easy to fit into the tiny sprites, plus it has that PAC-MAN nostalgia:

![monsters](public/dd846797e6a0fdb52d0a9729556499e840983ec8.png)

### [4020b16e396cd7be629499710f49b87182082cbc](https://github.com/nrkn/js1k-2019/tree/4020b16e396cd7be629499710f49b87182082cbc)

At this stage, I was already pretty much out of bytes, with no gameplay

The pretty, clever dungeons had to go. I implemented a much simpler generator
that created acceptable, but much crappier dungeons. Instead of using a graph,
it just randomly draws rectangles one at a time, then a corridor in a random
direction, then another rectangle at the end of the corridor etc until the
desired number of rooms are created. This means rooms and corridors often
overlap, which gives it a more organic but less Roguelike feel.

Another thing that had to go was the concept of having the walls just around
the edges of the rooms and corridors, which looks much nicer but was pretty
byte-hungry.

Here's an example of the dungeons generated by the crappy algorithm:

![crappy-dungeon](public/crappy-dungeons.png)


### [ebb60c27ba496baeba8d4fb2c9de4536f92ea7d5](https://github.com/nrkn/js1k-2019/tree/ebb60c27ba496baeba8d4fb2c9de4536f92ea7d5)

You can now walk around and fight monsters - both the player and the monsters'
color move closer to red as their health decreases. Some of the rooms were
larger than the viewport, so I added some random floor tiles because otherwise
if you were in a very large room you couldn't tell that you were moving and it
felt weird

![floors](public/ebb60c27ba496baeba8d4fb2c9de4536f92ea7d5.png)

### [6bbe12d05fa2cd4854891267fdd6b3d94006d2fb](https://github.com/nrkn/js1k-2019/tree/6bbe12d05fa2cd4854891267fdd6b3d94006d2fb)

I needed to add some more gameplay elements, like healing potions, but those
dungeons with rectangular rooms and corridors were just too greedy.

I ended up resorting to an old favourite technique, just randomly tunnelling
out a cave-like area

This version has potions, and most of the sprites were redrawn

![cave](public/6bbe12d05fa2cd4854891267fdd6b3d94006d2fb.png)


### [350736edee24bb62e4cb522478296c38871eca75](https://github.com/nrkn/js1k-2019/tree/350736edee24bb62e4cb522478296c38871eca75)

OK, so you can fight monsters and pick up healing potions, but once you'd
cleared the level, what more is there to do? It was time to add stairs to the
next level.

The walls are different colours on different levels, and I simplified the floor
sprites to save a few bytes

![stairs](public/350736edee24bb62e4cb522478296c38871eca75.png)

### [ddc17cd8b705c285185320d87bd5d2e7f5c7e7fe](https://github.com/nrkn/js1k-2019/tree/ddc17cd8b705c285185320d87bd5d2e7f5c7e7fe)

In a simple game, there should be some way to win.

When you get far enough down the dungeon, there's a statue you can get
(I chose this so I could reuse the player sprite) that allows you to win

![statue](public/ddc17cd8b705c285185320d87bd5d2e7f5c7e7fe.png)

I had to iterate this quite a bit to make a "win screen" that didn't take too
many bytes and came up with this:

![win](public/ddc17cd8b705c285185320d87bd5d2e7f5c7e7fe-win.png)

Some text or something saying "you win!" would have been nice, but wayyy too
many bytes!

### [819b253b0c1eeff93ffefa8becbe9bf68579e035](https://github.com/nrkn/js1k-2019/tree/819b253b0c1eeff93ffefa8becbe9bf68579e035)

The final thing I wanted was for the player to be able to have a weapon, and
for the monsters to drop sword upgrades and potions so that there is a reason
to fight them, rather than just trying to avoid them and get to the bottom
level.

The sword starts as a small knife and gets bigger (and more effective against
the monsters) as you pick up more sword upgrades

![sword](public/819b253b0c1eeff93ffefa8becbe9bf68579e035.png)

This addition really blew the byte count out - I didn't make a note, but it was
around 1200 bytes

From here, I won't show any more screenshots, but to get it under, I basically:

- removed the floor sprite
- changed it so that swords and potions just shared the same "item" sprite
  and you didn't know what it was until you picked it up - yuck
- removed all the colours except walls and player/monster health

I was *not* happy with this version, so I golfed as hard as I could in order to:

- have separate potion/sword sprites again
- have the exit have its own sprite
- add some colour back in

I golfed so well, that in the end I was able to also add:

- monsters drop a potion instead of a sword if your sword is already at max
- an extra monster sprite

...and that's where I'm calling it a day!
